title: Zapier Recipes for DevRel
---

When you think of devrel or developer advocacy (DA) you generally picture traveling the world and giving talks, speaking on podcasts, and organizing events. Well, you wouldn't be wrong really, but what you don't see is all the glue work it takes to tie all these pieces together. Most of my day as a DA is actually spent working with the teams within my company and community members to put all the pieces together to pull off a particular objective, like sponsoring and speaking at an event.

As you're network and your ideas grow, so will the amount of process and administrative work needed to be done to accomplish your goals. Some common tasks I find myself doing are:

- Setting up event registration
- Setting up a CFP for speakers or content request forms
- Set up meetings with vendors, venues, etc
- Manage social media accounts
- Setting up notifications for when a particular event happens
- Many more

This type of stuff takes a herculian effort to keep up and manage unless you find ways to automate most of it. That's where [Zapier](https://zapier.com) comes in. Zapier allows you to connect 1000s of apps together and automate workflows you would have to otherwise do manually. I've been making a lot of use of zaps (that's what you call a workflow in Zapier) and figured some of my favorite recipes!
