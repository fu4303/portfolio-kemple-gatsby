Following the recent changes to Medium and the new paywall, I've decided to move away from using blog hosting services and just use my own blog moving forward.

I considered using [Dev.to](https://dev.to) and think I will definitely cross-post to there since they support markdown and it would be relatively low effort to migrate a post. However, I'm all over the MDX train and think there is a lot of power that can be unlocked by embedding examples in the blog content itself.

```js react-live
const onClick = () => window.alert('Take that Medium')
render(<button onClick={onClick}>This is bad ass</button>)
```

Having the freedom to embed code along-side anything else is pretty awesome, no more creating gists that need to be updated in a different UI before re-publishing an article.

If you still use Medium, that's cool too. I just personally find the paywall to be problematic since I want whatever I write to be free and accessible for everyone. ðŸ’›

> I should note that I also plan to use this blog to talk about more than just tech! _(get ready for the crossfit, mental health, and work/life balance posts)_
