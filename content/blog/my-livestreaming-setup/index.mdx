title: My Livestreaming Setup
---

Over the last year I've become really interested in livestreaming, I like to pair program and to me it feels like pairing with a bunch of friends. I have a tendency to get really into my hobbies and streaming is no exception. It turned out to be a deeper rabbit hole than I imagined and I quickly discovered if you want to set up a quality stream there is A LOT that goes into it. I know big surprise, right?

After weeks of ordering the wrong cables, finding out certain cameras don't work with certain tools, and getting endlessly frustrated by Open Broadcaster Software (OBS, which is used to manage your streams), I decided to write down my experience so that when I have to set this up again in the future I can just refer to this post, and who knows, maybe someone else will find it useful too.

## Twitch

Most people seem to still stream on Twitch, however Microsoft's Mixr streaming platform is also an option. I chose to stick with Twitch because I could find the most resources on it. Since I had no idea what I was doing, this was a big plus for me. I still don't really understand all of Twitch. I think I'm not fully hip to that community yet so if I mention something in here that seems odd or is just not right, publicly shame me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kurtkemple)!

### Branding is Everything

The first thing I discovered about Twitch was that most streams that one would consider professional were extremely personalized, or branded if you will. There are a couple assets that you need for things like when you are offline, when you want to pause a stream, and then what you want displayed on screen when you're actually streaming (also known as a scene, more on scenes in a bit).
I found [this article](https://streamplaygraphics.com/twitch-image-sizes/) which does a good job of laying out what assets are needed and what size Twitch recommends for each asset. The basic sizes are:

- Twitch Offline Banner: 1920 x 1080 pixels
- Twitch Panels: 320 x 100 pixels
- Twitch Profile Banner: 1200 x 380 pixels
- Twitch Profile Picture: 256 x 256 pixels
- Twitch Thumbnail: 1280 x 720 pixels
- Twitch Overlay: 1920 x 1080 pixels
- Twitch Scene: 1920 x 1080 pixels

### Twitch Channel Manager

## Open Broadcaster Software - OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is the software you use to set up your audio and video for streaming, and stream it to Twitch. This is where you'll spend most of your time when it comes to setting up and managing your stream.
