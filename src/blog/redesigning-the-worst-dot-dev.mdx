title: Redesigning theworstdotdev - What I Want From My Digital Garden
---

As I get deeper into the idea of a digital garden. A few things start to become clear requirements for what the next version of this will look like:

- It needs to be dead simple to go from planting to sprouting
  - I want to be able to capture ideas and put them on the web as quickly as possible
- I want it ultra simple from a styling perspective
  - No custom fonts, very few images, smaller code snippets, nothing longer than a few minutes to read
- It needs to support multi media
  - I create and consume content across a wide range of medias and my garden should be able to support any of them
- I want it to have some community to it
  - I want to better recongnize contributions and give better credit and resources for ideas I make content about, but it needs to be mostly automated or abstracted with MDX
- I want it to support collaboration
  - I would love help tending to my garden and I would LOVE for folks to create curated lists on there own of my content, who better to help you curate than those that consume your content.
